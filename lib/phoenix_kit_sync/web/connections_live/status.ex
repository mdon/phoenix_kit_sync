defmodule PhoenixKitSync.Web.ConnectionsLive.Status do
  @moduledoc """
  Status-resolution and connection-verification helpers for the Connections
  LiveView.

  The LiveView spawns linked tasks that call into this module when it mounts
  or reloads the connections list:

  - `fetch_sender_statuses/1` — for each `receiver` connection, asks the
    remote site's `/sync/api/status` endpoint whether this site's paired
    sender is still reachable, sending `{:sender_status_fetched, uuid, status}`
    back to the LV once the HTTP round-trip completes.
  - `verify_receiver_connections/1` — for each `sender` connection we've
    previously handed off credentials to, asks the remote receiver whether
    the connection record still exists; sends `{:receiver_connection_severed,
    uuid}` when the remote says "no such connection," which the LV turns
    into a local suspend.

  Both are display-only — the tasks die with the LiveView via
  `Task.start_link/1`.

  Extracted from `ConnectionsLive` in 2026-04 to shrink the LiveView module
  without changing behavior. Task supervision semantics and message shapes
  are unchanged; the LV still owns the `handle_info` clauses that process
  the results.
